SLEEP
Zzzzzzz...

SURPRISE
I WASN'T SLEEPING, I-

DISAPPOINT
Oh, you're not RubRub.

REGULAR
Wait aren't you that kid that has been 
stuck on Stereo Madness for the past three months?

GLOAT
That was a joke, I know it has been five months.
That shopkeeper guy whines to himself very loudly.

GLOAT
Heh, you're supposedly a real pain in the gluteus.
Luckily only I have the power to speak in this vault.

REGULAR
...

SUS3

SUS1
...

DISAPPOINT
Okay whatever, now that I'm awake and bored as HECK,
I'll tell you what this place is.

TALK
this is The Vault. It stores all the top secret
unlockables in this mod which you can't get regularly.

SUS3
Ah lockpicks, did I say mod, I meant uhhhh...

SUS1
"Event in time which is canon to the
super important fnf storyline."

SUS2
...

TALK
You are allowed to collect these unlockables 
by entering secret codes in that chatbox right there,

TALK
or so RubRub says.

GLOAT
If you make an incorrect guess,

GLOAT
I will rightly make fun of you
by calling you stupid and ugly.

GLOAT
(It's part of my job description, sorry)

REGULAR
But if you make too many wrong guesses,

REGULAR
I suppose I can eventually
give you the occasional hint or two.

DISAPPOINT
You got it, codemaster? Start guessing.

GLOAT
Either that, or you can be a butt baby

GLOAT
and look up all of the secret codes on Google...

SUS3
...Please don't do that.
