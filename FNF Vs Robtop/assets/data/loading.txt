Beneath the skin
we are already ONE.

A loading screen with random text?
How original...

One coder, one artist,
about seven hundred composers.

Now that I think about it,
this is basically the exact same

Who remembers Dat Boi?

There are a lot of songs,
so I recommend pacing yourself.

This entire project started

Just putting that out there.

For all you know, this message is

your nearest technician.

visitors, so he secretly loves
having any company.

If you hug PotBor, he most likely
will bite in self defense.

Ignore that last loading screen
message, someone is simply hacking
your computer.

If we include the red eye cult symbol
somewhere, will people then think we
have a deep lore?

I love the smell of particle
generators in the morning.
