# FNF Vs Robtop
The mod **Breadward MacGluten** has been working on for 2 years... \
Shoutout to everyone from the team! \
I have to thank Bread and his amazing art skills! \
He also made the soundfont for Robtop along with **Fluffy** \
Duckstuffed is the guy we've been hanging out with while development \
**Valen** and **Myst** are people who i suggested we should hire! \
The mod with 1 artist, 1 coder and 5 composers! \
The first to use Godot (Atleast i think so) \
From Custom Notes to Dialogue to Voicelines to a Shop and a Vault to Platformer Mode to a Main Menu to Particles it's amazing! \
I joined the Team at around October 2021 and i don't regret it! \
After the past mods i've worked for which are **Beach Brother** and **Tabi** i can say that this is by far the craziest! \
And the first mod i've made music for... \
Thanks to everyone who supports this mod!
